# CalendarScheduler
---

CalendarScheduler is a open source tool which allows time-boxing with complex constraints, by Google's CP-SAT Solver from OR-Tools. 

This small script takes a list of constraints and a larger config file, as well as a list of todos and schedules these into a subscriptable Calendar for iCal, Google Calendar or a plain .ics-file.
